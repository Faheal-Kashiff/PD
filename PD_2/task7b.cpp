Name: "Dungeon Escape"

A 2D dungeon crawler game where the player navigates through a maze filled with traps, treasures, and enemies, aiming to escape the dungeon.
* The player moves through the dungeon using arrow keys (or WASD keys)
* The dungeon walls form a maze-like structure that the player must navigate
* Hidden traps are scattered throughout the dungeon. If the player steps on a trap, he loses health.
* Some traps can be seen, while others are hidden and only revealed after stepping nearby.
* Treasure chests appear randomly in the dungeon. The player can collect treasures to increase their score.
* Some treasures may offer health bonuses or special powers (e.g., temporarily revealing all traps on the map).
* Simple enemies move randomly or toward the player on the dungeon grid.
* If the player encounters an enemy, a simple turn-based fight occurs where the player must press a key to attack or dodge.

The player's main objective is to find the exit ("O") in the maze while avoiding enemies and traps.
When the player reaches the exit, they win the game.
